Thanks for new Telegram feature - comments, this bot generating someting like threads on reddit

First you should to do thats create channel and give there admin permissions for bot. Now bot can posting on your channel.

Than you should create discussion chat for using new feature.

Also i put config.py in .gitignore so you should create it in root directory.


File looks like:

BOT_TOKEN = 'Your token'

CHAT_ID = 'Your channel name' it looks like @mychannel.
